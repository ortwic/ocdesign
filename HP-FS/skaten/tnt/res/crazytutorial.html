<div class="title">FREESTYLE SLALOM: LEARNING 'CRAZY'</div>       

<div class="subtitle">Tutorial by <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060613215959/http://www.skatefreestyle.com/portfolio.html">Naomi Grigg</a></div>
<div align="right"><b><font size="4" color="#8f8f8f"><i><a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060613215959/http://www.skatefreestyle.com/">HOME</a></i></font></b></div>
<br>
<br>
<div class="sectionheader">So, you can snake through cones, you can 
crisscross through cones, and you're wondering where to go from here. So
 you learn all that whilst going backwards. And you're still wondering 
how you get from what you can do to being able to tie your feet in knots
 around cones as a freestyle slalomer.</div>
<br>
<div class="sectionheader">Let me present the 
          Crazy. It's the answer to all your dreams. A move that's 
          Impressiveness to difficulty ratio is just awesome and a lot easier to 
          master when you use the tricks that I've included in this tutorial. 
          You will need practice, but by getting as far as you already have, you 
          are clearly the type that is patient enough to put an hour our two 
          into a new move.
<br>
<br>
There are lots of videos of the crazy on the internet, but <a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20060613215959/http://www.skatefreestyle.com/crazymovie.wmv">here</a> is a very slow version to accompany the 
          tutorial</div>
<br>
<div class="sectionheader">I'm going to try to do 
          this a little differently to most of the tutorials I see. I'm not 
          going to tell you how to do it, I'm going to try to teach it to you, 
          or rather, get you to teach yourself - so you really want to print 
          this amazingly long tutorial out and take it to some cones with you. 
          </div>
<br>
<br>
<div class="sectionsubheader">Pre-requisites<hr size="1"></div>
<br>
<div>Do make sure you can criss-cross forwards 
          &amp; backwards before trying the crazy. Just one cone is absolutely 
          fine. There is no need to be able to repeat the move over any number 
          of cones, or be able to do it at any speed. Just be able to cross and 
          uncross your feet to go over a cone.</div>
<br>
<br>
<div class="sectionsubheader">Preparation 1: Choose a side<hr size="1"></div>
<br>
<div>Ideally, you will prefer passing over the cone with the same foot 
first when going both forwards &amp; backwards. Ie, if you like having 
your right foot in front when you criss-cross forwards, then in an idea 
world you would prefer having your right foot behind you when going 
backwards (so it is the first to cross the cone again). 
<br>
<br>
This isn't the case with you? it rarely is. But don't fret, because 
pretty much all of us had this problem. You need to choose - which one 
are you most able to change? Usually it is the forwards criss-cross, but
 not always. So before going any further, go and try them out - you'll 
need to know your side for the next bit.
<br>
<br>
In skating, 'right footed' and 'left footed' are impossible to define 
for slalom, as there is often little connection with how people prefer 
to do one move, and how they prefer to do another, so for the purposes 
of this tutorial, if you prefer to cross the cone with your RIGHT foot 
first, you are RIGHT FOOTED. And vice versa. Read that sentence again. 
And then thrice more. If you are reading a print out, highlight it. If 
not, tattoo the back of your hand.</div>
<br>
<br>
<div class="sectionsubheader">Preparation 2: Position yourself in the right place<hr size="1"></div>
<br>
<div>This isn't usually such an issue, as I'm right there, but I'm 
having visions of people stood at the start of a slalom line with a 
print out of this tutorial in one hand, dedicatedly following all the 
instructions, but getting it totally wrong because they are doing it in 
the wrong direction for the way their feet are going. So I suggest you 
take the opportunity to draw yourself a diagram.
<br>
<br>
If you are RIGHT footed, you will stand at the front of the cone line 
with the neat line of cones extending away to your LEFT. You will be 
standing about a half spacing to the right of the end of the cones, and 
about a half cone spacing back from the line. So the first cone is a 45 
degree angle to the way you are facing.
<br>
<br>
If you are LEFT footed (big cheer - we're not so common), the cones will be extending out to your RIGHT.</div> 
<br> 

<div align="center"> 
<img src="crazytutorial-Dateien/leftfooted1.jpg" border="0" height="154" hspace="10" width="205"> 
<img src="crazytutorial-Dateien/rightfooted1.jpg" border="0" height="154" hspace="10" width="205"> 
</div> 

<br> 
<div>Left footed is on the left, and right footed is on the right in these pictures</div>

<br>
<br>
<div class="sectionsubheader">The Move Itself:<hr size="1"></div>
<br>
<div>We're now ready to get started. The move itself repeats every 2 
cones, so once we're done with the first 2 it's just a case of 
repeating. Those two cones can be split into 4 steps. The good news is 
that one of the steps is forwards crisscross, and one is backwards 
crisscross. You're half way there!
</div>
<br>
<br>
<div class="sectionsubheader">Step 1: Forwards Criss-Cross<hr size="1"></div>
<br>
<div>…with a difference. Usually you will be travelling along the length
 of the cones, but here you will be travelling at 45 degrees to the 
length of the cones. You want to end up half way between the 1st two 
cones, but the other side of them, so they are behind you. If you are 
RIGHT footed you will be travelling towards your LEFT and vice versa.
<br>
<br>
So. Go do it. And make sure you uncross your feet without picking any of them up. That's vital.
<br>
<br>
It's the same as usual isn't it. But this time, stop after doing it. Stop just where I told you I wanted you to end up.
<br>
<br>
Difficulty? 
If you cross over a cone and uncross, without doing anything at the end,
 you're going to carry on. You're not doing anything wrong - you're just
 not doing anything to make you stop. That thing is the second step.</div>
<br> 
<br>         
<div class="sectionsubheader">Step 2: Forwards to Backwards transition<hr size="1"></div>
<br>          
<div>Move away from the cones. There is no need to use them whilst we 
practice this step. If you have chalk, draw a V on the ground, about 45 
degrees angle, an about the length of a long ruler (30cm).
<br>
<br>
Place your left foot (right/left footedness doesn't matter for this bit)
 on the bottom section of the left hand arm, along with most of your 
weight. Now put your right heel wheel on the other arm of the V - 
further up the V. 
<br>
<br>
<div align="center"> 

<img src="crazytutorial-Dateien/step2.jpg" border="0" height="290" hspace="10" width="406"> 

</div>
<br>
Feeling comfortable? LOL
<br>
<br>
Now I want you to swap. So your Right foot comes back onto all 4 wheels,
 down in the bottom of the V, and underneath your body, and as you do 
that, your left foot takes a trip up the left arm of the V and ends up 
on just the heel wheel. It should look a little like a very bad version 
of kazachoks. Keep swapping back &amp; forth for a while.
<br>

<br>
<br>
If you find that easy because you've been doing it for years of have 
great edge control, I'm just about to patronise you, so move to step 3 -
 but do make sure you have this step perfect, as step 4 relies on this.
<br>
<br>
For those of you that found yourselves sliding forwards out of the V, or
 yelling 'but I have a heelbrake you fool!!!!' at me, then read on.
<br>
<br>
If you have a heelbrake, and don't want to remove it, that's fine, but 
you will need to be careful during this bit of the move - either don't 
tilt your foot far up onto the heel, or do it all with all 8 wheels on 
the ground - but you need to be extra extra careful to have pretty much 
all your weight on the supporting foot, and not on the one that would 
normally be on the heel. I ask you to go onto the heel of the 
non-supporting foot because your body will automatically position its 
weight over the foot with all 4 wheels on the ground.

If you are riding out of the V, then we need to look at your edging. 
Your feet should be on their outside edges, so you look like you're 
riding a horse. Bowlegged even. You will need to bend your knees for 
this, and if it helps you to get the correct sensation of being on your 
outside edges for this move, you can undo your top buckles but be sure 
to do them back up before attempting the cones again. Try it again. You 
should find that you have a new feeling of 'clunk-click' when your feet 
change position - you will know when it feels right.
<br>
<br>
The 
          other thing that people commonly do wrong with this step, is 
to bring in one foot so they are both at the base of the V (ballet 
position 1) before letting the other foot travel out. Don't fall into 
this trap. Its nice and cosy, and you can hardly make out the edges of 
your comfort zone as they are so far away, but you need to sort this 
out. As one foot is coming in, the other foot is going out. You will 
feel your hips having to rise &amp; fall to allow it, and it is this 
rise &amp; fall that gives you the 'clunk-click' feeling.
<br>
<br>
Once you are bored stiff, go back to the cones.
<br>
<br>
Now do step 1 again, and in order to stop, do step 2. When you uncross 
from the forwards criss-cross you will be in a V position just like the 
start of step 2 (with your weight on your left foot if you are RIGHT 
footed, and vice versa), so now just switch everything over (step 2) and
 you will find yourself halted, and ready to travel backwards over the 
next cone.

<div class="sectionsubheader">Step 3: Backwards Criss-Cross<hr size="1"></div>
<br>          
<div>At the end of step 2, you will have your feet in a V and on the 
outside edges of your skates, so they will be in the perfect position to
 travel backwards, crossing over the 2nd cone.
<br>  
<br>  
Have a go a few times, putting these 3 moves together. 
<br>  
<br>  
A common problem is not being able to just slip neatly and effortlessly 
back over the 2nd cone. That's because you're still for step 2, and 
you're trying to cross your feet over as a way of getting going - 
essentially a stupid thing to be trying to do with 4 wheels on each 
foot. Its not because you're crap. After practice it wont be a problem 
because you will not actually lose much momentum during the forwards to 
backwards transition in step 2 - you will start to find that the weight 
shift itself gives you the momentum you need. In the meantime, its hello
 to new muscles. I make pretty much everyone stand there after step 2, 
and literally nudge themselves bit by bit back over the cone - you look a
 little like you're trying to hump an unseen object, especially with the
 grunting, but just remember how cool you'll look when you can do the 
crazy.
<br>  
<br>  
Once you can get back over the cone, with however little dignity, you 
are ready for step 4 - but make sure you are actually uncrossing your 
feet after the cone without picking any foot up. This is very important.
 You are learning, so I will let you drag your toe wheel across if you 
must, but NEVER let the foot leave the ground completely.</div>
<br>  
<br>
<div class="sectionsubheader">Step 4: Backwards to Forwards transition<hr size="1"></div>
<br>          
<div>This is the hardest step, but step 2 will have set you up with most of the technical bits.
<br>
<br>
Leave the cones again, and return to your V. Do the step 2 transition a 
couple of times as warm up, then turn 180 degrees so the V is upside 
down. Now put your left foot at the peak of the left arm, and your right
 foot further down the right arm, just on its toe wheel. Swap as before.
 
<br>

</div>
<br>
Everything is the same as for step 2 - the weight being on the 
supporting foot, the outside edges etc etc, except this time its much 
much harder. The reason it was so important to get step 2 right was to 
set you up for step 4.

It will require a lot of practice, but most problems can be sorted out using the advice from step 2.
<br>
<br>
Once you are semi-comfortable with this weight transition, return to the
 cones in the knowledge that whenever you see anyone doing any freestyle
 move where it looks like their legs are made of rubber, it is because 
they are using this weight transition. This is where it all comes from.
<br>
<br>
Back on the cones, fit it in just as you did with step 2 (when you have 
crossed the cone and uncrossed your feet, the weight should be on the 
left foot if you are RIGHT footed and vice versa). And then continue 
forwards over the 3rd cone as you start the whole cycle again. It is 
usually very hard for people to propel themselves over this cone, and my
 advice is just as unwelcome as it was earlier - budge yourself over bit
 by bit and carry on. It will be easier the 2nd time, easier still on 
the 3rd time and so on. If you don't go through this now, you'll never 
find it much easier. We all did it. I still remember when I could only 
do the crazy whilst facing down a slope.</div>
